# Web API IV Challenge

In this challenge, you will **deploy** an API of your choosing to `heroku`.

PROJECT SUBMISSION: For this project, I deployed the Web API challenge from yesterday's project to Heroku. I have sent the site's link to my PM for approval.
It can be found here: https://tico-sprint-9.herokuapp.com/

## Instructions

You are allowed, and **encouraged**, to collaborate with other peers. Please follow the twenty-minute rule, before seeking support from your PM and Instructor.

## Minimum Viable Product

Pick any API, could be one of your past projects, and deploy it to `heroku`. Once deployed, send the URL to the PM for your group.

## Stretch Goal

- add support for environment variables using `.env` files. You can use the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) npm module.
